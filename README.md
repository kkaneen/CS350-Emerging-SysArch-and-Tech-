# CS350-Emerging-SysArch-and-Tech-

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The two project artifacts I chose was module five and module 3 projects. The purpose of these was to setup a timerCallback as well as UART_DATA_BINARY.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I was able to make use of the statemachine well and implement timers correctly. Although it took some time to fully understand these projects, I felt like I gained a better understanding of what needed to be done and to create timers with SOS message through the CC3200S.
Where could you improve?
There are many areas of improvement for me. It took  me a while each week to ensure my code was making a connection with the CC3200. I grew to understand the program more and I feel that my state machine could be better in many ways. The GPIO on and off LED wasnt set up the best, I needed to set that up better and I think if i took more time to really understand each line of code I could have greatly improved this area.
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Code Composer Studio is a new program that I am not too well educated on. I would add this as a resource for future projects. this scope of network within their network really helped answer many questions I had thoughout this course. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Coding, understanding different peripherials and wirelless controllers. I think this overall class helped me understand the real world devices we use everyday and how they are made and impacted with everyday use.
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I always feel that organization is key to any success with projects. The overall simplicity of code needs to be sure to not only maintain but be readable. Its always easy to create code that you understand, so I made sure to reasearch and understand key concpets of what was needed to be changed and make sure it was something anyone could understand and maintain.
